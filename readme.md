# Hands-on with OpenCV

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Hands-on with OpenCV" repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of practical examples, projects, and code snippets designed to showcase the capabilities and usage of OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library.

OpenCV is a powerful library that enables image and video analysis, processing, and computer vision tasks. The main goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning experience with OpenCV through a diverse range of practical examples and projects. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn OpenCV or an experienced developer seeking inspiration and code samples, this repository is a valuable resource for you.

## Highlight

All the code in this repository is implemented in `Jupyter Notebook`, specifically in `Hands-on-with-OpenCV.ipynb`. The development process involved the use of `Python`, `OpenCV`, and other Python libraries such as `Matplotlib` and `Numpy`. `Matplotlib` is utilized for image visualization and plotting, while `Numpy` is used for array transformations.
