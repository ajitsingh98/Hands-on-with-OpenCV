# Hands-on with OpenCV


In this notebook, I have used openCV from basics to advanced for image and video processing tasks. For each section I have briefly added the introduction about it. Coding part is done in `Python`. I have also used `numpy` for array transformations and `matplotlib` for plot visulaization.
